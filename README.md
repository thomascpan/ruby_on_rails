Course: Ruby on Rails

Link: http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails

Description: In this course, you'll be doing a whole lot of building, each project a bit more advanced than the previous one. You'll build about a dozen Rails projects from scratch, including one full-featured tutorial that we'll be following along with as we go and a full scale web application of your own. More importantly, you'll learn how to deconstruct a website into its underlying data architecture and then build an application around that. By the end of it all, you'll have the confidence to put up a simple website in under an hour.

List of Projects:
* Getting Your Feet Wet With Rails (Blogger)
* Micro-Reddit
* Rest Tester
* Private Events
* Odin Flight Booker
* Using Twitter Bootstrap (with Newsweek)
* Design your Own Grid-Based Framework (with Bootstrap)

Note: Some larger projects are excluded from this repository and may be hosted seperately.
